##Work Experience 

###Full-Time
####{`Set/2012 up until now`} | Consultant at [NOVABASE](http://www.novabase.pt/), working at [SAPO](http://www.sapo.pt) a company owned by [Portugal Telecom](http://www.telecom.pt/)


####{`Set/2009 to Set/2012`} | Web Developer at [Kriação](http://kriacao.pt/) 
Softconcept was a small company that specialized on developing a strong and full-fledged CRM for Hotels. This Huge application was web-based and took care of every possible aspect of Hotel maintenance and operation. 

#####I did...
I was part of a team that was put together to rebuild the app from the ground up. I was closely managed by a team leader that had a very precise vision of the final product and helped us achieve short daily goals. We all worked together on almost every feature, but I spent more time around the PHP/JS/PLSQL that dealt with reservations, room planning and accounting.

#####I worked with...
- PHP 4, JS, CSS. 
- lots of AJAX, with YUI and Prototype.js
- XML/SOAP
- ORACLE/PLSQL

#####I Learned...
As a first full time job, Softconcept was a perfect place to learn about the working environment of IT companies. I worked with very skilled developers who welcomed me as their newbie. Meenwhile, I had time to learn basic skills like version controll, development and deployment workflow, and self time/task management.

Meanwhile, I had time to learn basic skills like version control, development and deployment workflow, and self time/task management. The opportunity  to work with Oracle also shaped my view and expertise around databases since.




####{`Fev/2004 to Aug/2004`} | From dishwasher to Receptionist at [Albergaria Acez](http://www.albergaria-acez.pt/) 
Hey, It's not a complete CV if I don't list all my full time positions... I worked 9 months on a 4 star hotel, 
started as a dishwasher and got "promoted" to waitress in the first week. Worked for 3 more months at the Hotel's (very fancy) Restaurant and got "promoted" again to Receptionist.
The time I spend taking care of reservations and dealing with hotel logistics proved to be very important for my next full time job almost 4 years later.
I left _Albergaria Acez_ in favor of my High School education and to pursue the dream of one day becoming a Software Developer.


###Freelance {`2006 to set/2008`}
I started coding (as a job) around 2006. With my first freelances I leaded valuable lessons that led me to never do freelance again.
Unfortunately most of these projects and companies are now gone (it's been almost 10 years). The freelance projects included:
- Dynamic presentations and small flash games
- Simple Website&Backoffice ex: [Solaris Hotel](http://www.solarishotel.pt/), [skandia](http://www.skandia.pt/), [BemMeQuer](http://www.bemmequer.com.pt/)
- Micro CRM backoffice for bestway.com.pt
- ZenCard modules for online shops
