#### {`Set/2012` to Abr/2015} Consultant at [NOVABASE](http://www.novabase.pt/), working at [SAPO](http://www.sapo.pt) a company owned by [Portugal Telecom](http://www.telecom.pt/)

SAPO was a giant in Portugal working with everything "web". I joined a team called "onDemand" that dealt with streaming content, be it video with [MEO Kanal](http://kanal.pt/), music with [MEO Music](http://music.meo.pt/), or games [MEO Jogos](http://jogos.meo.pt/). All three projects were multi-platform and had thousands of active users on each platform (Mobile/PC and TV) every day.

##### I did...

I was focused on backoffice and frontend, but I also helped on everything else the team did. From building webservices from the groud up to architecture and scale backoffices, I've worked mainly with PHP. As of the frontend, apart from the web, some of the projects had in-house developed apps that were fully made with javascript. It was a very small team on a very large company but we were self reliant and self sufficient, with (almost) full control over the projects, code, and infrastructure.

##### I worked with...

- the _best god damn_ tech team in Portugal
- PHP5, JS, CSS3
- Codeigniter, SLIM, PHPunit and other php frameworks and tools
- jQuery, ink.js and other JS frameworks and tools
- GIT, SVN
- Memcache, redis
- node, grunt, npm, vagrant, apache
- XML/JSON SOAP/REST clients and servers
- SQL, MySQL, Maria, PostgreSQL, Solr

#### {`Set/2009 to Set/2012`} Web Developer at [Kriação](http://kriacao.pt/)

_Kriação_ is a-more-than-10 year old agency that operates around new media and web-marketing, most of its clients were local, but from time to time I had the opportunity to work with big names in Portugal. Kriação had incredible project variety and output, with short timings, huge pressure and a very passionate team that made it all feel like a breeze.

##### I did...

We had a lot of clients, so the work was either maintenance on old projects or the development of completely new ones. I developed our own CRM framework and later extended it to an E-Commerce platform, this framework was used internally in the development of most of the projects by me and other colleagues. I also worked with facebook API in the development of marketing campaigns and contests, and with multiple Payment gateway services and invoicing API's in order to make the E-Commerce part work.

##### I worked with...

- PHP 3/4 and 5, JS, CSS.
- MVC frameworks and OOP
- UI and UX with jQuery and Prototype.js
- Webservices: XML/JSON SOAP/REST clients
- SQL, MySQL

##### I Learned...

A Lot... Besides the huge technical improvements I learned how to deal with pressure and how to deal with failure. _Kriação_ had such a wide scope that I ended up coding a bit of everything. I also had time to learn about project management and client expectations as we often had direct contact with the final client. _Kriação_ was great to build up team spirit, entrepreneurship and the capacity of setting and achieving goals for myself.

#### {`Jan/2009 to Set/2009`} Web Developer at [Softconcept](http://www.softconcept.pt/)

_Softconcept_ is a small software house that specialized on developing strong full-fledged products for Hotel Management. This Huge applications were web-based and took care of every possible aspect about owning and managing an Hotel. It's main client was the [Vila Galé Group](http://www.vilagale.com/), an 18 Hotels chain, all of them covered by a single centralized CRM.

##### I did...

I was part of a team that was put together to rebuild the app from the ground up. I was closely managed by a team leader that had a very precise vision of the final product and helped us achieve short daily goals. We all worked together on almost every feature, but I spent more time around the PHP/JS/PLSQL that dealt with reservations, room planning and invoices.

##### I worked with...

- PHP 4, JS, CSS.
- AJAX, with YUI and Prototype.js
- XML/SOAP clients
- ORACLE/PLSQL

##### I Learned...

As a first full time job, _Softconcept_ was a perfect place to learn about the working environment of IT companies. I worked with very skilled developers who welcomed me as their newbie. Meanwhile, I had time to learn basic skills like version control, development cycles, deployment workflows, and self time/task management. The opportunity to work with Oracle also shaped my view and expertise around databases to this day.

### Freelance

<!--- .position -->

#### {`2006 to set/2008`}

I started coding (as a job) around 2006. Working on my first freelances made me learn valuable lessons that led me to never do freelance again.
Unfortunately most of these projects and companies are now gone (it's been almost 10 years). The freelance projects included:

- Dynamic presentations and small Flash games
- Simple PHP Websites with custom CMS
- Simple PHP CRM systems and plugins
- ZenCard modules for online shops
